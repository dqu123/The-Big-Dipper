Make commands:
    make              =>   Build all, runs tests, and webserver.
    make clean all    =>   Make clean and build.
    make webserver    =>   Make webserver.
    make test         =>   Build and run tests.
    make run_server   =>   Run webserver.
    make proxy_handler_test   =>   Run proxy_handler_test.
        This test is separate because it takes a while to run. (around 5 minutes)

Dispatch mechanism:
    map set up by getMappings() in utils.cc/.h
    Passed to WebServer constructor in webserver.cc/.h 
        and webserver_main.cc
    WebServer calls HandleRequest() in Webserver::run()

To make a new Handler:
    1. Write newHandler.cc/.h
        See static_file_handler.cc/h for an example.
        Need to instantiate Configure() and HandleRequest()
        virtual methods.
    2. Include newHandler.h in utils.h and webserver.h
    3. Update getMappings() in utils.cc to handle 
        a new type of server.

Tests are located in config_parser_test.cc
    1. To make a test for a handler, look at the
        RequestHandlerTest class.
